Dwm is an exceptionally fast, lightweight, and dynamic window manager for X, developed by the talented team at suckless.org. This build is my personal version of dwm, where Iâ€™ve applied several patches to enhance its functionality and usability, making it more 'sensible' while maintaining its minimalist approach, rather than strictly adhering to the 'suckless' philosophy.

** Patches added to this build include:
+ floatrules (setting the status bar width and floating coordinates)
+ statuspadding (horizontal and vertical padding in the status bar are now configurable options)
+ attachaside (new clients appear in the stack rather than as the master)
+ uselessgap (adding gaps when more than one window)
+ rotatestack (moves a window through the stack, in either direction)

** The dependencies for imariom-dwm include:
+ ttf-inconsolata-nerd (you can substitute it with your preferred nerd font family)
+ ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols
+ Alacritty
+ rofi

Also, you will need to add the following from the AUR:
+ https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/ (needed for colored fonts and emojis)
